Dynamic Variables:
---------------------------
1)Stored in heap memory (a region of memory for dynamic allocation).
2)Their size can be increased or changed during runtime.
3)When returned from a function, they are not automatically deleted — you must manually free the memory (especially in languages like C/C++).

Static Variables:
---------------------------
1)Usually stored in stack memory, or in static/global memory depending on context.
2)Their size is fixed and cannot be changed after declaration.
3)When returned from a function, they may get deleted (if stored on the stack) — unless declared as static, which keeps them alive even after the function ends.

Optional Note for Clarity:
---------------------------
1)In C/C++, "static" variables inside functions are not stored on the stack — they stay in memory for the lifetime of the program.
2)Heap memory is slower but flexible. Stack memory is faster but limited and temporary
